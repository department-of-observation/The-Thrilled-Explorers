Instructions to run the thrilled explorers(testbed) app--------------------------------------------

For Non-Android Phone Users:

Download android studio at https://developer.android.com/studio/
Configure android studio and use any emulator of preference
For configurations, please check Android developers website for information about emulators and set-up.
Open the zip folder uploaded on devpost and import the project into android studio
Run the project on the emulator and have fun exploring the app.
Note: The UI for this app is not suited to be viewed on the emulators provided on android studio as it has been designed to fit a samsung galaxy Pixel XL, using that phone will yield best graphics.

It is advisable to use an actual android phone for anything to do with GPS tracking etc as an emulator is not reliable.
Tip: For Non-Android Phone Users, It is advisable to borrow an android phone to run the app as it would make the app alot easier for you to use and makes life easier!:)

For Android Phone Users:

Connect a USB cable that allows for data transfer between phone and PC/Laptop.
Go to Settings on your android phone and activate USB debugging under developer options.
Run and upload the app directly onto the android phone
App will run automatically onto phone and app is now free to use on the app.
For further changes to app, repeat steps 1 to 3 whenever new changes are added.
